Vladof is an attempt to make running embarassingly parallel code via
OpenCL as simple as writing procedural code.  The main goal is to make
it possible to write Monte-Carlo code for non-interacting particles
that runs in the GPU without writing any actual OpenCL code.

If this ever goes anywhere, I'll improve the documentation.  This code
is currently pre-alpha, so don't use it.
